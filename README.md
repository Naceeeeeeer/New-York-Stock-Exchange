# New York Stock Exchange Dataset Exercice:

This repository contains the code and data for performing exploratory data analysis, building a deep neural network model for regression, optimizing hyperparameters using GridSearch, visualizing loss and accuracy during training, and applying regularization techniques on the New York Stock Exchange dataset.

# Dataset:
The dataset used in this project can be found at New York Stock Exchange | Kaggle. It includes historical stock prices and fundamental data for various companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The first step is to apply exploratory data analysis techniques to understand and visualize the dataset. The code provided reads the dataset and performs various operations such as extracting stock values for a specific company, calculating correlations, and visualizing the data using pair plots.

# Deep Neural Network Architecture
To handle the regression task, a deep neural network architecture is established using the PyTorch library. The code provided defines a custom dataset class (CSVDataset) for loading the data, and a multi-layer perceptron model class (MLP) for implementing the neural network architecture.

# Hyperparameter Optimization
The GridSearch tool from the scikit-learn library is used to choose the best hyperparameters for the model. The code provided demonstrates how to perform a grid search to find the optimal values for hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizers, epochs, and model architecture.

# Visualization of Training Progress
The code also includes functions for visualizing the training progress of the model. Specifically, it plots graphs of loss versus epochs and accuracy versus epochs for both the training and test data. These graphs provide insights into the model's performance and can help in interpreting its behavior.

# Regularization Techniques
In addition to the initial model, several regularization techniques are applied to the architecture. The obtained results are then compared with the performance of the first model. Regularization techniques help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.
